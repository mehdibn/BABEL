# BABEL

**B**ig d**A**ta **BE**nchmarking p**L**atform, a generic, architecture-level and scalable benchmarking platform, destined to the real-time collection, analytics and reporting of data and events shared between the layers of complex Big Data applications.

*Benchmark name is inspired from the myth of the Tower of BABEL, used to justify the origin of the presence of multiple spoken languages.*


# Features 


The main **features** of BABEL: 
- **Genericity**: technology-, application- and architecture-agnostic. 
- **Dynamicity**: runs in parallel with the system, without interfering with its behavior, and with negligible overhead.
- **Adaptability**: adapts to any number of layers in the Big Data application, as well as to any type of data and workloads.
- **Multi-Paradigm**: able to benchmark streaming and batch processing systems, as well as operational and decisional platforms.
- **End-to-End Solution**: evaluates the behavior of the whole system, by measuring application- and system-level metrics.
- **Real-time Reporting**: offers a real-time reporting layer, that illustrates the system's metrics on the fly.
- **Distribution and Scalability**: configurable, and offer a  scalable collection, processing engines and  storage, in order to enable the continuous archiving of metrics for a better analysis.
- **Agility**: flexible during the different integration phases and also at run-time, new layers, metrics, and processing jobs can be added on the fly.
